# Yuval Agam's MTEC-343 Midterm Project

My goal is to research and present on the work of Francesco Corvi (nesso.xyz), specifically his use of Tidal Cycles. I encountered a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww8SceHFOn8&t=677s) of one of his live performances, which raised the following questions:

- How does he create seamless transitions between sections of his performance?
- How is he using Tidal Cycles for sound design? Is he integrating other softwares? Does he rely on sampling techniques similar to Dirt samples?

I have reached out to Corvi regarding his creative process, and if he has any code samples to share for this specific performance. Here are some resources I have found:

- [Github profile](https://github.com/fracnesco) with a repo called "TidalTutorials"
- [Website](https://www.nesso.xyz/)
